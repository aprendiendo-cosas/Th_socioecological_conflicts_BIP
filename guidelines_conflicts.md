## Objectives 

The learning objectives we set here are:

+ To be aware of how important conflict resolution is when we want to manage complex systems.
+ To begin to understand how skills called "soft" are as important as the "hard" scientific knowledge we acquire in most subjects.
+ To know the different types of conflicts and the most common ways to address them.



## Contents and narrative

The following presentation (downloadable [here](https://github.com/aprendiendo-cosas/Th_socioecological_conflicts_BIP/raw/2024_2025/presentation/environmental_conflicts.zip) for Mac, [here](https://github.com/aprendiendo-cosas/Th_socioecological_conflicts_BIP/raw/2024_2025/presentation/environmental_conflicts.exe) for Windows shows the narrative followed in the session.

The main ideas addressed during the session are:

+ Definition of conflict, origins, and main types. 
+ Ways to address conflicts:
  + Mapping the conflict: involves several steps:
    + Identify the key actors. 
    + Characterize the values, beliefs, and interests of those actors.
    + Gather the available scientific evidence about the issue in dispute.
    + Identify the social, ecological, and economic impacts of the conflict.
    + Consider whether the involved parties are willing to address the conflict using effective communication techniques.
    + When the answer to the above is "no," we enter the realm of imposition. Public or private authorities impose a non-consensual solution.
    + This usually perpetuates the conflict because both parties do not feel heard.
  + Conflict management. This is related to the idea of "dancing" with the complex systems we discussed in previous sessions. The idea is to delve into the reasons for the conflict to negotiate starting positions, identify solutions (and trade-offs). This allows for adopting solutions in which the involved actors feel that they have gained something.
